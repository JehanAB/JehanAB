### 💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Jehan 👋, a Front-End Web Developer. I turn coffee ☕ and code 💻 into responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular.  

I love solving tricky problems with simple solutions and experimenting with new technologies. Always learning, always coding, and occasionally making my code (and myself) a little fun 😄.
